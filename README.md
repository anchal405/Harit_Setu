HaritSetu is a climate-first digital platform that bridges the gap between **farmers** and **eco-conscious buyers** for the responsible exchange of crop residues like straw, husk, and stalks.

Every year, thousands of tons of crop residues are burned, especially across North India, leading to toxic air pollution. HaritSetu offers a smart and sustainable alternative â€” helping farmers list their residues for sale and buyers to reuse them in industries like biofuel, compost, and packaging.

The platform features:
- AI-powered price prediction (trained on 1000+ real records)
- Clean, mobile-friendly UI designed for rural India
- Multilingual chatbot (KrishiMitra) with Hindi, English, and Hinglish support
- Filters for buyers to search by location, residue type, and month

Developed under the theme **Sustainable Tech and Climate Innovation**, HaritSetu empowers farming communities with technology, encourages zero-waste practices, and promotes green entrepreneurship â€” ensuring smarter selling with *no smoke in between*.

## AI Model â€“ Smart Pricing with Fairness

HaritSetu uses a regression-based machine learning model to **predict the price of crop residues** based on real-world agricultural factors. The goal is to ensure that farmers receive **fair, data-driven pricing** instead of relying on middlemen or guesswork.

### Key Details:
- **Algorithm:** Regression using Scikit-learn
- **Training Data:** 1000+ real entries from open agricultural sources
- **Input Parameters:** Crop Type, Residue Type, State, District, Month, and Quantity (kg)
- **Output:** Predicted Price per Kg (INR)
- **Libraries Used:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Security Measures:** The model includes logic to avoid unrealistic predictions and manipulation

This model empowers farmers to **negotiate confidently**, reduces dependency on intermediaries, and ensures more **transparent pricing** in the rural supply chain.
